#### AJAX for all!

In this chapter, we're going to take a good look at how we can use AJAX in a XOOPS module. We're going to use jQuery for this, as it's the most popular javascript library around - however, you can use other libraries as well! We're just going to use jQuery.

Now, first of all, what is AJAX? AJAX is a technology that allows us to update pieces \(or even our entire webpage\) without having to reload it. Google Maps is a good example of an AJAX website!

This can be really handy and usefull and when it's correctly implemented it can also lighten the load on your server.

So where should you use AJAX? Well, that depends on what you want to achieve. You can use AJAX to provide table sorting on date, use it to submit forms without reloading your page, use it to load up articles when you scroll down and many others.

The possibilites are nearly endless! Let's get started with AJAXifying our module!
